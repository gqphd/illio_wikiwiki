Imagine this kind of virtual tradeshow could be hung in frontpage of yours!
I think it would be great if you have virtual tour in your website.
Your clients would understand more easily how good is your tour is. What do you think?

What makes us BETTER than google street view is
 - We can do both indoor and outdoor,
 - distance between each snapshot is far narrow than google's one
   (each 360 photo is taken at every feet or half a feet.)
 - It will help you look more natural.


We have some free time in 11~13 JAN,
and we want to use our time in more meaningful way.
We want to capture your hotel then!

Please note that our main concern is not the money, but actual use case in USA
So we are proposing nominal value of <b>$10</b>.
The deal does not have to be done this week;
you can first let us do the scanning job and do the rest later.
There's not much asking when we do the job;
just open all the door where i would go. I planned a path,
and only you have to do is permission that I scan your facility and tour program.
I will be in the US until the 13th and then return to Korea.
Hope to hear from you soon and take to scan
