What I do is virtual tour, something like this.

I think it would be great if you have virtual tour in your website. Your clients would understand more easily how good is your resort is. What do you think?

Why makes us BETTER than google street view is, I can do both indoor and outdoor, and distance between each snapshot is far narrow than google's - each 360 photo is taken at every feet or half a feet.
It will help you look more natural.

We have some time in 11~13 JAN. We want to capture your hotel then. There¡¯s not much asking - just open all the door where i would go. I planned a path, and only you have to do is permission that I scan your resort. I will be in the US until the 13th and then return to Korea.
Hope to hear from you soon and take to scan

Please note that our main concern is not the money, but actual use case in USA, so we are proposing nominal value of $10. The deal does not have to be done this week; you can first let us do the scanning job and do the rest later.

My phone number is +16504318958 so I ask for your understanding. Just call me!
